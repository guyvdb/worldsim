All cultures are comprised of people:
  - who share common ground
  - and are born of a shared philosopy
  - who adhere to specific goals
  - which require the setting aside of differences
  - and demands of each member personal sacrifieces of time, effort, resources
  - in order for all members to work for the good of the group
  - and to survive, propagate and grow beyond the lifetimes of current members.
