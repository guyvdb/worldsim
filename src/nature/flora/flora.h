  Plants are easy to make up, and unless you go too far out of the
normal realm of plant life, most people aren’t even going to blink.
You do not need to tell us the plant growth cycle, show us how it
photosynthesizes or anything like that. You tell me it’s a shrub with
blue-green leaves, and the bark can be boiled to make a healing tea
for fevers, fine. As long as you are consistent, I don’t care. You tell
me that plant gets up and walks, we may have an issue. I want to know how.


plant types -- Native, invasive (weeds), and horticultural.

 People will be able to describe plants. Is it a tree, shrub, or ground cover? Does
 it have spiky or rounded leaves? Does it flower? Does it have vine-like runners?


 Next you should know if the plant is a perennial or annual. If it’s a perennial does
it reseed itself, or are people or animals involved? What climate or region does
this plant grow in? A bog plant like a Venus fly trap would be out of place on a
mountainside. A cactus would be out of place in a tundra.
