Notes on the economic mechanisms
======================================

Sources - things that create resources
Drains - the consumption of resources
Converts - turn resources into higher level resources - technology gains can increase the efficiency of converts
Traders - move resources from one entity to another


What are the econmic shapes at a macro level (lines on a graph for distribution, production, etc)


Negative feedback loop creates equlibrium -- makes systems resistant to change - the point of stabilisation is equlibrium
To have dynamic equlibrium you need to have a dynamic factor that is independant of the feedback. I.e. it could increase the
equlibrium over time.


Positive feedback creates an arms race. Positive feedback can cause mutual dependencies which can cause deadlocks. Need resource
to buy resource harvester. Need resource harvester to get resources -- deadlock. Positive feedback works to amplify small differences.
Positive feedback can be destructive. In chess if you loose a piece it weakens your position which may make it more likley to
loose another piece.


Use internal econmics to create large probability space.
